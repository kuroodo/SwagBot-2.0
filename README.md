# SwagBot-2.0
A Discord bot made with JDA.

This project is [SwagBot](https://github.com/kuroodo/SwagBot) rebuilt from the ground up, and with support for multiple guilds!
This project is a learning process; feel free to learn with me!

At the moment the project still needs to undergo testing/tuning and is slightly incomplete compared to the original.
Some things that need working on are consistent error/feedback messages, inconsistencies throughout the code, exception handling, and better documentation.

Planned features include more fun commands, more moderation commands, polls, using reactions for behaviors such as giving roles, and games.
